## About the Project

![Screen Shot](imagenes/screenshot.png)

A Flutter-based app that allows users to play any game with their friends through Steam's Remote Play Together feature.

This feature's *really* useful, however it is locked down to only games enabled to do this by the dev.
I've tried apps like RemotePlayWhatever before, but i've encountered some issues with them, so the Exe-replacing method ended up being the most functional for me, and this app simplifies it for everyone.

Features:
- A flutter-powered lightweight and fast desktop app.
- Takes into account possible errors and offers quick solutions.
- Add your own games and emulators to the launcher.
- Placeholder EXE for convenience (You can individually check that exe out at [the nwreplacement repo](https://github.com/maximoospital/nwreplacement))
- Easily guided through tutorials.
